# <img src="/icon.png" alt="[Logo]" style="vertical-align:middle"> Random-Mathematician's Github web page. 

The purpose of this site mixes miscellaneous resources with mathematics and coding articles which would be harder to publish regularly or not be sufficiently complete for a full publication. It also stores reference pages, so that specific information could be accessed directly from the website, without needing to search for it.

## Navigation

The entirety of the information presented is accessible online at the URL https://random-mathematician.github.io/. There, links to all other documents are provided, in order if they form a series, and the same links will be avaliable in every page through the top navigation bar, arranged by topic.

> [!NOTE]
> As of June 29th, 2025, this is not yet true. It will be true when the page is officially relased, since for now the website is under construction and not supposed to be interacted with.

## List of pages and files

Right now, the following pages are avaliable:
- None

Again, the site is under construction. But the pages that are *accesible to the public* are:
- [The Main Page](index.html) - The starting page, ~~set up to start the user's tour~~ **empty**.
- [An HTML tag reference](HTMLtaglog.html) - So that I never forget how to HTML.

Finally, some other files are present to make the website work:
- **The README** - You are here!
- [The logo](icon.png) - The one you can see at the start of this README.
- [A CSS generic stylesheet](RMstyle.css) - To give the pages their look.

## Known issues and bugs

If something is wrong with the page, it should be listed below. That way, it can be fixed earlier.
1. The page is under construction.
    > Can't have bugs if you're blank!

If you find any mistakes not on this list, be sure to contact me through my GitHub.

## To-Do list

What I'm currently working on:
- Adding a top navigation bar (and perhaps a footer) to pages.
- Setting up the main page, a user tour, and a way of organizing articles.
- Finnishing the HTML tag log with a CSS reference and examples.
- Writing a "paper" on a logicomathematical framework based on nested propositional logic instead of the more common set-theoretic approach.

## About the fonts used

The *DejaVu Serif* and *DejaVu Serif Bold* fonts are used in this project. Both TTF files are found inside the [fonts](/fonts/) folder and are intended only for use within the site.

The *DejaVu* fonts are a font family based on the Bitstream Veraâ„¢ Fonts  v1.10, with the purpose of providing a wider character set.
